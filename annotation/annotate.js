//	   Children have You ever met the Bogeyman before
//	   No, of course You haven't for You're much too good, I'm sure;
//	   Don't You be afraid of him if he should visit You,
//	   He's a great big coward, so I'll tell You what to do
//
//	   Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman,
//	   Don't let him come too close to You, he'll catch you if he can.
//	   Just pretend that you're a crocodile
//	   And you will find that Bogeyman will run away a mile.
//
//	   Say Shoo shoo and stick him with a pin
//	   Bogeyman will very nearly jump out of his skin
//	   Say buzz buzz just like the wasps that sting
//	   Bogeyman will think you are an elephant with wings
//
//	   Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman
//	   Tell him you've got soldiers in your bed
//	   For he will never guess that they are only made of lead
//
//	   Say Hush hush, he'll think that you're asleep
//	   If you make a lovely snore away he'll softly creep
//	   Sing this tune you children one and all
//	   Bogeyman will run away, he'll think it's Henry Hall!
//
//	   When the shadows of the evening creep across the sky
//	   And your Mummy comes upstairs to sing a lullaby
//	   Tell her that the bogeyman no longer frightens you
//	   Uncle Henry's very kindly told you what to do
//
//	   Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman
//	   Don't let him come too close to you, He'll catch you if he can.
//	   Just pretend your teddy bear's a dog
//	   Then shout out, 'Fetch him, Teddy!' and he'll hop off like a frog.
//
//	   Say Meoow, pretend that you're a cat
//	   He'll think you may scratch him that make him fall down flat
//	   Just pretend he isn't really there
//	   You will find that Bogey man will vanish in thin air
//
//	   Here's one way to catch him without fail
//	   Just keep a little salt with you
//	   and put it on his tail
