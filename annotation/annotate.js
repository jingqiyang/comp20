//	   10-14 Children have You ever met the Bogeyman before
//	   14-17.5 No, of course You haven't for You're much too good, I'm sure;
//	   17.5-21.5 Don't You be afraid of him if he should visit You,
//	   21.5-26 He's a great big coward, so I'll tell You what to do
//
//	   26-29 Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman,
//	   29-33.5 Don't let him come too close to You, he'll catch you if he can.
//	   33.5-37.5 Just pretend that you're a crocodile
//	   37.5-41.5 And you will find that Bogeyman will run away a mile.
//
//	   41.5-45.5 Say Shoo shoo and stick him with a pin
//	   45.5-49.5 Bogeyman will very nearly jump out of his skin
//	   49.5-53 Say buzz buzz just like the wasps that sting
//	   53-57.5 Bogeyman will think you are an elephant with wings
//
//	   57.5-61 Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman
//	   65-68.5 Tell him you've got soldiers in your bed
//	   68.5-72 For he will never guess that they are only made of lead
//
//	   80.5-84.5 Say Hush hush, he'll think that you're asleep
//	   84.5-88 If you make a lovely snore away he'll softly creep
//	   88-92 Sing this tune you children one and all
//	   92-96 Bogeyman will run away, he'll think it's Henry Hall!
//
//	   96-100 When the shadows of the evening creep across the sky
//	   100-104 And your Mummy comes upstairs to sing a lullaby
//	   104-108 Tell her that the bogeyman no longer frightens you
//	   108-111.5 Uncle Henry's very kindly told you what to do
//
//	   111.5-115.5 Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman
//	   115.5-119.5 Don't let him come too close to you, He'll catch you if he can.
//	   119.5-123 Just pretend your teddy bear's a dog
//	   123-126.5 Then shout out, 'Fetch him, Teddy!' and he'll hop off like a frog.
//
//	   135-139 Say Meoow, pretend that you're a cat
//	   139-143 He'll think you may scratch him that make him fall down flat
//	   143-147 Just pretend he isn't really there
//	   147-150.5 You will find that Bogey man will vanish in thin air
//
//	   159-162.5 Here's one way to catch him without fail
//	   162.5-166 Just keep a little salt with you and put it on his tail
