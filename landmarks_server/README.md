***2019 NOTE:  
This is a copy of the files from the actual original heroku repository. The only 
thing I changed was renaming the .git directory to "dotgit" (to prevent 
conflict between git repos).  
  
The url of the server is dry-depths-90755.herokuapp.com, and the repository is 
git@heroku.com:dry-depths-90755.git.  
  
I frankly don't remember how any of this works, but you can probably run it 
locally with npm install && npm start.
